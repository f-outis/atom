- Note about analyze Modern banking services :
    -- In home of developer user on every modern service machine(Ineternet bank, Mobile bank, etc.), there is folder called echo. It connect to channel application of its associated modern application, and sends an echo message to MBGateway application. In its response we can find out health of the MBGateway application. In case, if the spi time-out occurs and responses take too long in milliseconds, we can conclude that the health of MBGateway application is not good. Slow Internet bank, USSD,etc. are side effects of this issue.
    We can increase two parameters of MBGateway' configuration  :
      --- In cm-channel-jms.properties file :
            channel.concurrentConsumers = 10
      --- In db.properties file :
            db.poolSize = 20

            db.poolSize must be 2 times higher that channel.concurrentConsumers.
