1.Version Control: Git, SVN
  It's unacceptable not to use version control, even if you're a solo developer

2.Virtualization: VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker
  With virtualization tools, having separated development environments on a per project basis is really nice to have, and easy to set up with VirtualBox and Vagrant at least.
